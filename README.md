# phylogenetic_networks
Sandbox for exploring phylogenetic networks

Need to make `log_run`, `ref_files`, and `vcf_files` directories

In Progress :

`consensus.sh`
  - generates consensus sequence for each sample name for defined region and appends to output `.fa` file 
  - have to manually change sample names, region of interest, reference file, vcf file and output file
